# ProFL: A fault localization framework for Prolog

ProFL is a fault localization command-line tool for Prolog models. Given a faulty Prolog model and a corresponding test suite, ProFL will calculate which Prolog statements are the most likely to be faulty or have the highest "suspiciousness". ProFL has three components: A tool that determines test coverage for the given test suite on the Prolog model, ProFL-s which is a spectrum-based fault localization technique and ProFL-m which is a mutation-based fault localization technique.
